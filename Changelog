*******************************************************************************

V1.06 - 12.08.2016

If fxload should be found in multiple locations, the first one is now
preselected in order to spare the user typing in a path and to avoid mistakes.
It is still possible to enter a path to fxload manually.

Checking the presence of the Fractal Audio Systems license file, the USB
firmware file and fxload now prior to announcing the license text.

V1.05 - 10.04.2016

If the Axe-FX II has been powered up and connected via USB during the
installation process, the script now takes care that the Axe-FX II will
immediately work as a USB audio and midi interface as soon as the script
finishes. Only in case this fails, the user gets prompted and will have to
reboot the Axe-FX II or to dis- and reconnect the USB cable.


*******************************************************************************

V1.04 - 17.10.2015

added information what functionality will probably be achieved in case a kernel
older than version 3.10 has been found.

Added version information option "-v".
